Overtone is an open source audio environment being created to explore musical
ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and
collaborative jamming.  We use the
[SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) synth server as the audio
engine.  Synthesizers, effects, analyzers and musical generators can be
programmed in [Clojure](http://clojure.org) or designed in a visual data flow
editor similar to [PureData](http://puredata.info/) or
Max/MSP.  The environment will be integrated with a peer-to-peer network that
allows for collaborative sessions over the internet and easy sharing of
instruments and effects.

Checkout the [roadmap](/roadmap.html) for more information about what we're up to.

#### Cross Platform

Overtone runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.  You just need to have [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/)
and [Java](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp) installed to run it (plus the
[jack](http://jackaudio.org/) audio server in Linux).
